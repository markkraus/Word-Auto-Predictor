# Solving the Autocomplete Problem

Solving Autocomplete.java can be best described by working in a sequential manner from A2Test.java. I went through A2Test.java, and 
analyzed how each method was being called there from the Autocomplete class. Then, starting with the first method called, which was 
the boolean add() method, I worked to get valid output method by method until all were written. I used the DLBNode subclass, and
kept track of three global variables, two DLBNodes that pointed to the root node of the DLB trie, and one that pointed at the 
current node being worked on all throughout the program. When a word was being added to the trie, I pointed to the root character 
of that word - the first letter in the word - and continously went down the trie to each child which corresponded to the letter, 
if I couldn't find the child, I added it, then I recursively added to each node's word count. I made sure to always retreat back to
the root node at the beginning of each method so as to not get lost in the trie. This was an early issue I had; I was moving the root
node pointer around in my adding a word to the trie implementation early on, and this caused unexpected behaviors in other methods because
of the position of this global variable.

# Asymptotic Analysis of the Program: Worst Cases

## boolean add(String word)

Due to the searching of the nodelet lists of each level, starting at the root, and going all the way to each child, the worst case that this program
will run is every nodelet in the trie. This means the size of our alphabet at the time of adding the current word, multiplied by the word length, since
we would have to search the entire alphabet of each child list. This would give alphabet size * word.length -> **O(alphabet size * word.length)**.

## boolean advance(char c)

Here my implementation simply adds the letter passed in to the prefix StringBuilder, and recursively finds the last node of the prefix, ultimately the 
letter we passed in. In the worst case, this will search the alphabet of this nodelet's sibling list, leaving us with a runtime of **O(alphabet size)**.

## void retreat()

Again, my implementation simply gets the last character in the prefix after deleting the previously last character. In the worst case, we search 
**O(alphabet size)** of characters in the nodelete's sibling list. 

## void reset()

My implementation simply creates a new StringBuilder for the current prefix, resetting all its contents. This is done in constant time; **O(1)**.

## boolean isWord()

Here, I simply check if the node we are working with exists and, if it does, if it already creates a word in the DLB trie. If so, I return true, 
else, I return false. Again, constant time; **O(1)**.

## void add()

Very similar to *boolean add()*; however, we first make sure the current node we are pointing at actually exists, meaning our prefix will be valid. If so,
we just call *boolean add(currentPrefix)*. In the worst case, we hit **O(alphabet size * currentPrefix.length)**.

## int getNumberOfPredictions()

Simply return the *node.size* property of the node, indicating how many words this node is a part of in the trie. Since we just return this value, we
run this method in **O(1)** time.

## String retrievePrediction()

Once we find a node that is a word node, we get the path of that node, and return that path, ultimately that word. So, this is dependant upon the prediction
word length, meaning in the worst case, we are hitting **O(prediction.length)**.
